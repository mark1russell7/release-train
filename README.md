# release-train

The release train reads the npm packages of the GitHub account `mark1russell7`. It makes the dependency graph of these packages and a plan of the next releases and updates.

Stage 1 only reads. It changes no repository and publishes nothing.

## What it reads

- The repositories of the account. It skips archived repositories and forks.
- The root `package.json` of each repository, and each workspace package of `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `package-lock.json`, for the resolved versions.
- The `latest` version of each package on the npm registry.

A package is a `package.json` with a name and without `"private": true`. An edge is a dependency on a package of the account.

## The actions of the plan

| Action | When |
|---|---|
| `new-package` | The package is not on npm. Only the owner can make a new package. |
| `release` | The version on `main` is newer than npm, or a dependency range of the package changes. |
| `adopt-in-range` | The range lets the newest version in, but the lockfile holds an older version. A lockfile update is sufficient. |
| `adopt-breaking` | The newest version is outside the range. The range must change. |

Each repository gets one combined action of each kind. The plan puts the actions in a topological sequence and shows each cycle.

## Use

```sh
GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) pnpm --filter @release-train/release-train plan
node packages/release-train/src/bin.ts plan --json
node packages/release-train/src/bin.ts plan --write-db <folder>
```

- `--public-only` removes each private repository from the output.
- `--out <file>` writes the full plan as JSON.
- `--no-progress` does not read the pull requests and the release runs.

## CI

`plan.yml` computes the plan every 6 hours and on a manual start. It keeps `plan.json` as a workflow artifact. It uses the default token, so it sees only public repositories.
